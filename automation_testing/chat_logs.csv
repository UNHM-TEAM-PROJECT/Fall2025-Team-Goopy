Failure to officially withdraw will result in an AF grade, which is maintained and included in the grade point average (GPA). Not attending classes does not constitute an automatic withdrawal. Students are notified by the Graduate School when this administrative action is taken and are required to apply for readmission or reinstatement if they subsequently desire to resume their academic program. This procedure is not applicable to graduate students who have received failing grades in 9 or more credits since dismissal is automatic in that case (see Academic Standards section.)
