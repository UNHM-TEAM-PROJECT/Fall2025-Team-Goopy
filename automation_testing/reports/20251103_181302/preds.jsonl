Qualified senior students at the University of New Hampshire may be admitted to an approved accelerated graduate program in the Graduate School provided they have followed normal application procedures; they must have been admitted for the semester in which they wish to enroll in courses for dual credit. A 3.20 cumulative grade point average is normally required to be considered for the program. Students are normally admitted prior to the start of their senior year. Students who have been admitted to the program may register for a maximum of 12 credits of 800-­level courses prior to completing their bachelor's degree. Such courses may, upon recommendation of the department and approval of the Graduate School, count toward both the bachelor's and master's degrees. Up to 8 credits, upon recommendation of the department and approval of the Graduate School, may count towards both the bachelor's degree and a graduate certificate. For more information and a list of eligible programs, visit: https://gradschool.unh.edu/academics/accelerated-masters-program . Consecutive Master's Degrees. Enrollment in consecutive master's degrees refers to admission and matriculation in a second master's degree program at the University of New Hampshire after the completion of the requirements for a first master's degree earned at the University of New Hampshire. A student may apply up to 12 credits earned in the first master's degree awarded at the University of New Hampshire toward a second master's degree with approval of the student's graduate advisory committee and/or graduate program coordinator in the second master's program. Thesis or research credits from the first program may not be counted toward the requirements of the second program. Concurrent Dual Degrees. Enrollment in concurrent dual degrees occurs when a student is admitted to and matriculated in two graduate degree programs at the University of New Hampshire simultaneously. A student may pursue concurrent degrees only with approval of the appropriate graduate program coordinator(s) and the dean of the Graduate School. With approval of the student's graduate advisory committee(s) and/or the graduate program coordinator(s), a student may apply up to 12 UNH credits earned in one master's degree toward the requirements for a second master's degree. A student must complete the capstone requirements for both programs. Completion of degree requirements for the two programs need not be at the same time. Integrated Dual Degrees. Integrated dual degrees occurs when two graduate programs have formalized a program of study which creates an integrated program linking the two disciplines, while continuing toward separate degrees. Students must be admitted to both programs and complete the requirements for both degrees. Integrated dual degree programs may include a single admissions process, submission of a single thesis or capstone experience, and a single advisory committee composed of members from both programs. The number of required credit hours for integrated dual degrees must not be less than 80 percent of the total minimum hours required to complete each degree separately. Integrated dual degree programs must be approved by the Graduate Council and the dean of the Graduate School. Cotutelle Ph.D. Agreements with International Universities. A cotutelle is a Ph.D. jointly awarded by two universities from different countries. Under such an arrangement, a doctoral student completes the requirements of the Ph.D. program in both the home and partner university, conducts dissertation research collaboratively, sequentially, and for roughly equal amounts of time in both universities, and is supervised by a faculty member from each of the universities. The dissertation is then examined by a committee whose members are drawn from both institutions. A degree is awarded from each university with acknowledgment on the transcript of the cotutelle. All cotutelles must have a fully approved cotutelle agreement signed by multiple institutional representatives at both universities including the Office of International Students and Scholars (OISS). UNH faculty or students interested in developing a cotutelle should contact the Graduate School to get detailed instructions about what is required for a cotutelle agreement and the associated approval process."}], "transformed_query": "What happens if an accelerated master’s student earns below B- in a graduate course while in dual status?"}

The dissertation is then examined by a committee whose members are drawn from both institutions. A degree is awarded from each university with acknowledgment on the transcript of the cotutelle. All cotutelles must have a fully approved cotutelle agreement signed by multiple institutional representatives at both universities including the Office of International Students and Scholars (OISS). UNH faculty or students interested in developing a cotutelle should contact the Graduate School to get detailed instructions about what is required for a cotutelle agreement and the associated approval process. All standard policies relating to time to degree, residency requirements, academic standards, and minimum GPA required to graduate apply to any dual-­degree arrangement."}, {"rank": 5, "idx": 11490, "score": 0.468574, "title": "Accounting and Finance (ACFI) - Accounting and Finance (ACFI) - ACFI 845 - International Accounting", "url": "https://catalog.unh.edu/graduate/course-descriptions/acfi/", "tier": 2, "tier_name": "general_info", "text": "Question: What are the requirements for admission to the Graduate School?\n\nAnswer: Admissions - Applying for Admission Persons holding a baccalaureate degree from an accredited college or university may apply for admission to the Graduate School.

For more information and a list of eligible programs, visit: https://gradschool.unh.edu/academics/accelerated-masters-program . Consecutive Master's Degrees. Enrollment in consecutive master's degrees refers to admission and matriculation in a second master's degree program at the University of New Hampshire after the completion of the requirements for a first master's degree earned at the University of New Hampshire. A student may apply up to 12 credits earned in the first master's degree awarded at the University of New Hampshire toward a second master's degree with approval of the student's graduate advisory committee and/or graduate program coordinator in the second master's program. Thesis or research credits from the first program may not be counted toward the requirements of the second program. Concurrent Dual Degrees. Enrollment in concurrent dual degrees occurs when a student is admitted to and matriculated in two graduate degree programs at the University of New Hampshire simultaneously. A student may pursue concurrent degrees only with approval of the appropriate graduate program coordinator(s) and the dean of the Graduate School. With approval of the student's graduate advisory committee(s) and/or the graduate program coordinator(s), a student may apply up to 12 UNH credits earned in one master's degree toward the requirements for a second master's degree. A student must complete the capstone requirements for both programs. Completion of degree requirements for the two programs need not be at the same time. Integrated Dual Degrees. Integrated dual degrees occurs when two graduate programs have formalized a program of study which creates an integrated program linking the two disciplines, while continuing toward separate degrees. Students must be admitted to both programs and complete the requirements for both degrees. Integrated dual degree programs may include a single admissions process, submission of a single thesis or capstone experience, and a single advisory committee composed of members from both programs. The number of required credit hours for integrated dual degrees must not be less than 80 percent of the total minimum hours required to complete each degree separately. Integrated dual degree programs must be approved by the Graduate Council and the dean of the Graduate School. Cotutelle Ph.D. Agreements with International Universities. A cotutelle is a Ph.D. jointly awarded by two universities from different countries. Under such an arrangement, a doctoral student completes the requirements of the Ph.D. program in both the home and partner university, conducts dissertation research collaboratively, sequentially, and for roughly equal amounts of time in both universities, and is supervised by a faculty member from each of the universities. The dissertation is then examined by a committee whose members are drawn from both institutions. A degree is awarded from each university with acknowledgment on the transcript of the cotutelle. All cotutelles must have a fully approved cotutelle agreement signed by multiple institutional representatives at both universities including the Office of International Students and Scholars (OISS). UNH faculty or students interested in developing a cotutelle should contact the Graduate School to get detailed instructions about what is required for a cotutelle agreement and the associated approval process."}, {"rank": 3, "idx": 11502, "score": 0.534461, "title": "Accounting and Finance (ACFI) - Accounting and Finance (ACFI) - ACFI 872 - Corporate Financial Reporting", "url": "https://catalog.unh.edu/graduate/course-descriptions/acfi/", "tier": 2, "tier_name": "general_info", "text": "Question: What are the requirements for admission to the Accelerated Master's Program?\n\nAnswer: Admissions - Accelerated Master's Program gradschool.unh.edu/academics/accelerated-masters-program Qualified senior students at the University of New Hampshire may apply early and be admitted to the Graduate School prior to completing their bachelor's degree provided they have followed normal application procedures and have been admitted for the semester in which they wish to enroll in courses for dual credit (the first semester of their senior year).

Enrollment in concurrent dual degrees occurs when a student is admitted to and matriculated in two graduate degree programs at the University of New Hampshire simultaneously. A student may pursue concurrent degrees only with approval of the appropriate graduate program coordinator(s) and the dean of the Graduate School. With approval of the student's graduate advisory committee(s) and/or the graduate program coordinator(s), a student may apply up to 12 UNH credits earned in one master's degree toward the requirements for a second master's degree. A student must complete the capstone requirements for both programs. Completion of degree requirements for the two programs need not be at the same time. Integrated Dual Degrees. Integrated dual degrees occurs when two graduate programs have formalized a program of study which creates an integrated program linking the two disciplines, while continuing toward separate degrees. Students must be admitted to both programs and complete the requirements for both degrees. Integrated dual degree programs may include a single admissions process, submission of a single thesis or capstone experience, and a single advisory committee composed of members from both programs. The number of required credit hours for integrated dual degrees must not be less than 80 percent of the total minimum hours required to complete each degree separately. Integrated dual degree programs must be approved by the Graduate Council and the dean of the Graduate School. Cotutelle Ph.D. Agreements with International Universities. A cotutelle is a Ph.D. jointly awarded by two universities from different countries. Under such an arrangement, a doctoral student completes the requirements of the Ph.D. program in both the home and partner university, conducts dissertation research collaboratively, sequentially, and for roughly equal amounts of time in both universities, and is supervised by a faculty member from each of the universities. The dissertation is then examined by a committee whose members are drawn from both institutions. A degree is awarded from each university with acknowledgment on the transcript of the cotutelle. All cotutelles must have a fully approved cotutelle agreement signed by multiple institutional representatives at both universities including the Office of International Students and Scholars (OISS). UNH faculty or students interested in developing a cotutelle should contact the Graduate School to get detailed instructions about what is required for a cotutelle agreement and the associated approval process."}, {"rank": 5, "idx": 11501, "score": 0.691532, "title": "Accounting and Finance (ACFI) - Accounting and Finance (ACFI) - ACFI 871 - Financial Theory", "url": "https://catalog.unh.edu/graduate/course-descriptions/acfi/", "tier": 2, "tier_name": "general_info", "text": "Question: What are the admissions requirements for the Accelerated Master's Program?\n\nAnswer: Admissions - Accelerated Master's Program ( University of New Hampshire Seniors) gradschool.unh.edu/academics/accelerated-masters-program"}], "transformed_query": "What is the minimum GPA to apply to the Accelerated Master’s program?"}

Under such an arrangement, a doctoral student completes the requirements of the Ph.D. program in both the home and partner university, conducts dissertation research collaboratively, sequentially, and for roughly equal amounts of time in both universities, and is supervised by a faculty member from each of the universities. The dissertation is then examined by a committee whose members are drawn from both institutions. A degree is awarded from each university with acknowledgment on the transcript of the cotutelle. All cotutelles must have a fully approved cotutelle agreement signed by multiple institutional representatives at both universities including the Office of International Students and Scholars (OISS). UNH faculty or students interested in developing a cotutelle should contact the Graduate School to get detailed instructions about what is required for a cotutelle agreement and the associated approval process."}, {"rank": 4, "idx": 11420, "score": 0.601048, "title": "Graduate Courses - Graduate Courses - Simultaneous 700/800 Courses", "url": "https://catalog.unh.edu/graduate/academic-regulations-degree-requirements/courses/", "tier": 1, "tier_name": "academic_regulations", "text": "Question: What is the difference between a 700-­level course and a 800-­level course?\n\nAnswer: Graduate Courses - Simultaneous 700/800 Courses 800-­level courses may be cross-­listed with 700-­level courses and taught simultaneously to both graduate and undergraduate students.
