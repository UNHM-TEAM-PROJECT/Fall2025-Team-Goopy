Qualified senior students at the University of New Hampshire may be admitted to an approved accelerated graduate program in the Graduate School provided they have followed normal application procedures; they must have been admitted for the semester in which they wish to enroll in courses for dual credit. A 3.20 cumulative grade point average is normally required to be considered for the program. Students are normally admitted prior to the start of their senior year. Students who have been admitted to the program may register for a maximum of 12 credits of 800-­level courses prior to completing their bachelor's degree. Such courses may, upon recommendation of the department and approval of the Graduate School, count toward both the bachelor's and master's degrees. Up to 8 credits, upon recommendation of the department and approval of the Graduate School, may count towards both the bachelor's degree and a graduate certificate. For more information and a list of eligible programs, visit: https://gradschool.unh.edu/academics/accelerated-masters-program . Consecutive Master's Degrees. Enrollment in consecutive master's degrees refers to admission and matriculation in a second master's degree program at the University of New Hampshire after the completion of the requirements for a first master's degree earned at the University of New Hampshire. A student may apply up to 12 credits earned in the first master's degree awarded at the University of New Hampshire toward a second master's degree with approval of the student's graduate advisory committee and/or graduate program coordinator in the second master's program. Thesis or research credits from the first program may not be counted toward the requirements of the second program. Concurrent Dual Degrees. Enrollment in concurrent dual degrees occurs when a student is admitted to and matriculated in two graduate degree programs at the University of New Hampshire simultaneously. A student may pursue concurrent degrees only with approval of the appropriate graduate program coordinator(s) and the dean of the Graduate School. With approval of the student's graduate advisory committee(s) and/or the graduate program coordinator(s), a student may apply up to 12 UNH credits earned in one master's degree toward the requirements for a second master's degree. A student must complete the capstone requirements for both programs. Completion of degree requirements for the two programs need not be at the same time. Integrated Dual Degrees. Integrated dual degrees occurs when two graduate programs have formalized a program of study which creates an integrated program linking the two disciplines, while continuing toward separate degrees. Students must be admitted to both programs and complete the requirements for both degrees. Integrated dual degree programs may include a single admissions process, submission of a single thesis or capstone experience, and a single advisory committee composed of members from both programs. The number of required credit hours for integrated dual degrees must not be less than 80 percent of the total minimum hours required to complete each degree separately. Integrated dual degree programs must be approved by the Graduate Council and the dean of the Graduate School. Cotutelle Ph.D. Agreements with International Universities. A cotutelle is a Ph.D. jointly awarded by two universities from different countries. Under such an arrangement, a doctoral student completes the requirements of the Ph.D. program in both the home and partner university, conducts dissertation research collaboratively, sequentially, and for roughly equal amounts of time in both universities, and is supervised by a faculty member from each of the universities. The dissertation is then examined by a committee whose members are drawn from both institutions. A degree is awarded from each university with acknowledgment on the transcript of the cotutelle. All cotutelles must have a fully approved cotutelle agreement signed by multiple institutional representatives at both universities including the Office of International Students and Scholars (OISS). UNH faculty or students interested in developing a cotutelle should contact the Graduate School to get detailed instructions about what is required for a cotutelle agreement and the associated approval process."}, {"rank": 3, "idx": 4656, "score": 0.64693, "title": "Secondary Education (M.A.T.) - Secondary Education (M.A.T.) - Accelerated Master's Overview - Accelerated Master's Requirements", "url": "https://catalog.unh.edu/graduate/programs-study/education/secondary-education-mat/", "tier": 4, "tier_name": "program", "text": "Section: Secondary Education (M.A.T.) - Secondary Education (M.A.T.) - Accelerated Master's Overview - Accelerated Master's Requirements\n\nStudents must attend a mandatory orientation session.

Enrollment in concurrent dual degrees occurs when a student is admitted to and matriculated in two graduate degree programs at the University of New Hampshire simultaneously. A student may pursue concurrent degrees only with approval of the appropriate graduate program coordinator(s) and the dean of the Graduate School. With approval of the student's graduate advisory committee(s) and/or the graduate program coordinator(s), a student may apply up to 12 UNH credits earned in one master's degree toward the requirements for a second master's degree. A student must complete the capstone requirements for both programs. Completion of degree requirements for the two programs need not be at the same time. Integrated Dual Degrees. Integrated dual degrees occurs when two graduate programs have formalized a program of study which creates an integrated program linking the two disciplines, while continuing toward separate degrees. Students must be admitted to both programs and complete the requirements for both degrees. Integrated dual degree programs may include a single admissions process, submission of a single thesis or capstone experience, and a single advisory committee composed of members from both programs. The number of required credit hours for integrated dual degrees must not be less than 80 percent of the total minimum hours required to complete each degree separately.

It is highly recommended that students meet with their Graduate Academic Advisors from both programs prior to starting their Dual Degree to insure they have a clear understanding of each program's prerequisites, degree requirements, course schedules, and to determine the best time to take their MPP coursework. Students are required to start their first year of the MPP/JD Dual Degree program in the fall at the UNH Franklin Pierce Law School and complete at least one year of their Juris Doctor curriculum ( Juris Doctor: Residential (J.D.) Program or Juris Doctor: Daniel Webster Scholar Honors (J.D.) Program ) prior to starting their MPP program. Students complete their year of MPP coursework at the Carsey School of Public Policy in their second or third year of the MPP/JD Dual Degree program with guidance from their JD Academic Advisor. Students are advised to have taken an introductory level economics class prior to starting their MPP program such as a “principles of economics” course (macro or micro)."}], "transformed_query": "Can I do a dual degree?"}

Core Curriculum The MS Biotech:IBMS core curriculum is centered around research project team-based lab courses. This provides you with important industry-relevant transferrable job skills, such as clear communication, cooperation and relationship building, teamwork and conflict resolution, and creative problem-solving and strategic thinking. These transferrable skills are developed hand-in-hand with the wet-lab skills. In addition to the core lab and lecture coursework covering the major industry areas of cell, molecular, and protein biochemistry, the program incorporates a core course entitled “Biotechnology Products and Regulation.” This course takes a critical look at industry from the initial stages of research and development in the biomedical sciences through the legal and regulatory stages of biotechnology product development and manufacturing. This content is key to understanding how the biotech industry functions and thus is a centerpiece in your training in our degree program. Finally, you are required to enroll in a minimum of one graduate biotech seminar course. While the specific content of the seminar courses will vary to reflect the dynamics of the ever-changing biotech field, the two typical focus areas of the semester-long seminars will be “Instrumentation in the Biotech Industry” and “Cutting edge topics in the Biotech Industry today”. Elective Courses In addition to the Core requirements, you will develop a curriculum plan with your Faculty Advisor that includes elective courses. This curriculum plan will be customized to meet your career goals. While most students will likely choose elective courses offered in the Department of Life Sciences at UNH Manchester, the program welcomes you to enroll in courses in other UNH colleges in order to complete your elective requirements.

Full-time students can complete the program in 18 months. Students admitted from a UNH Bachelor’s degree program can complete the Accelerated Master's program in 12 months depending on the courses completed during their undergraduate program. Students choosing the project or internship track would undertake an internship or internships in industry, applied research in an industrial job where the student is already employed, or research in a faculty member’s laboratory at UNH. Students choosing the co-op work experience route would spend 6 months in a full-time industrial placement as part of their degree program. The MS Biotech:IBMS program welcomes students from varied scientific and other backgrounds who have the required basic skills to succeed in the degree program. Normally, this background includes completion of a Bachelor’s degree (GPA > 3.0) with an introductory biology two-course sequence with lab, a genetics course (lab not required), and at least one semester of organic chemistry. Students with non-biomedical Bachelor’s degrees with these skills are encouraged to apply for admission. UNH Bachelor’s degree students in a variety of curricular areas would similarly be able to apply for admission as an Accelerated student if they meet the pre-requisite requirements above.

Enrollment in consecutive master's degrees refers to admission and matriculation in a second master's degree program at the University of New Hampshire after the completion of the requirements for a first master's degree earned at the University of New Hampshire. A student may apply up to 12 credits earned in the first master's degree awarded at the University of New Hampshire toward a second master's degree with approval of the student's graduate advisory committee and/or graduate program coordinator in the second master's program. Thesis or research credits from the first program may not be counted toward the requirements of the second program. Concurrent Dual Degrees. Enrollment in concurrent dual degrees occurs when a student is admitted to and matriculated in two graduate degree programs at the University of New Hampshire simultaneously. A student may pursue concurrent degrees only with approval of the appropriate graduate program coordinator(s) and the dean of the Graduate School. With approval of the student's graduate advisory committee(s) and/or the graduate program coordinator(s), a student may apply up to 12 UNH credits earned in one master's degree toward the requirements for a second master's degree. A student must complete the capstone requirements for both programs. Completion of degree requirements for the two programs need not be at the same time. Integrated Dual Degrees. Integrated dual degrees occurs when two graduate programs have formalized a program of study which creates an integrated program linking the two disciplines, while continuing toward separate degrees. Students must be admitted to both programs and complete the requirements for both degrees. Integrated dual degree programs may include a single admissions process, submission of a single thesis or capstone experience, and a single advisory committee composed of members from both programs. The number of required credit hours for integrated dual degrees must not be less than 80 percent of the total minimum hours required to complete each degree separately. Integrated dual degree programs must be approved by the Graduate Council and the dean of the Graduate School. Cotutelle Ph.D. Agreements with International Universities. A cotutelle is a Ph.D. jointly awarded by two universities from different countries. Under such an arrangement, a doctoral student completes the requirements of the Ph.D. program in both the home and partner university, conducts dissertation research collaboratively, sequentially, and for roughly equal amounts of time in both universities, and is supervised by a faculty member from each of the universities. The dissertation is then examined by a committee whose members are drawn from both institutions. A degree is awarded from each university with acknowledgment on the transcript of the cotutelle. All cotutelles must have a fully approved cotutelle agreement signed by multiple institutional representatives at both universities including the Office of International Students and Scholars (OISS). UNH faculty or students interested in developing a cotutelle should contact the Graduate School to get detailed instructions about what is required for a cotutelle agreement and the associated approval process."}, {"rank": 2, "idx": 2880, "score": 0.734779, "title": "Admissions - Admissions - Accelerated Master's Program", "url": "https://catalog.unh.edu/graduate/general-information/admissions/", "tier": 2, "tier_name": "general_info", "text": "Section: Admissions - Admissions - Accelerated Master's Program\n\nEach program's faculty retain discretion regarding whether their program admits students under the accelerated master's program, as well as the maximum number of graduate credits permitted (e.g., some programs will allow for a maximum of 8 credits, or 1 course, etc.).
