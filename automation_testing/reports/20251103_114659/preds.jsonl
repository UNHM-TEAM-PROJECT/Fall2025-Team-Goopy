Such courses may, upon recommendation of the department and approval of the Graduate School, count toward both the bachelor's and master's degrees. Up to 8 credits, upon recommendation of the department and approval of the Graduate School, may count towards both the bachelor's degree and a graduate certificate. For more information and a list of eligible programs, visit: https://gradschool.unh.edu/academics/accelerated-masters-program . Consecutive Master's Degrees. Enrollment in consecutive master's degrees refers to admission and matriculation in a second master's degree program at the University of New Hampshire after the completion of the requirements for a first master's degree earned at the University of New Hampshire. A student may apply up to 12 credits earned in the first master's degree awarded at the University of New Hampshire toward a second master's degree with approval of the student's graduate advisory committee and/or graduate program coordinator in the second master's program. Thesis or research credits from the first program may not be counted toward the requirements of the second program. Concurrent Dual Degrees. Enrollment in concurrent dual degrees occurs when a student is admitted to and matriculated in two graduate degree programs at the University of New Hampshire simultaneously. A student may pursue concurrent degrees only with approval of the appropriate graduate program coordinator(s) and the dean of the Graduate School. With approval of the student's graduate advisory committee(s) and/or the graduate program coordinator(s), a student may apply up to 12 UNH credits earned in one master's degree toward the requirements for a second master's degree. A student must complete the capstone requirements for both programs. Completion of degree requirements for the two programs need not be at the same time. Integrated Dual Degrees. Integrated dual degrees occurs when two graduate programs have formalized a program of study which creates an integrated program linking the two disciplines, while continuing toward separate degrees. Students must be admitted to both programs and complete the requirements for both degrees. Integrated dual degree programs may include a single admissions process, submission of a single thesis or capstone experience, and a single advisory committee composed of members from both programs. The number of required credit hours for integrated dual degrees must not be less than 80 percent of the total minimum hours required to complete each degree separately. Integrated dual degree programs must be approved by the Graduate Council and the dean of the Graduate School. Cotutelle Ph.D. Agreements with International Universities. A cotutelle is a Ph.D. jointly awarded by two universities from different countries. Under such an arrangement, a doctoral student completes the requirements of the Ph.D. program in both the home and partner university, conducts dissertation research collaboratively, sequentially, and for roughly equal amounts of time in both universities, and is supervised by a faculty member from each of the universities. The dissertation is then examined by a committee whose members are drawn from both institutions. A degree is awarded from each university with acknowledgment on the transcript of the cotutelle. All cotutelles must have a fully approved cotutelle agreement signed by multiple institutional representatives at both universities including the Office of International Students and Scholars (OISS). UNH faculty or students interested in developing a cotutelle should contact the Graduate School to get detailed instructions about what is required for a cotutelle agreement and the associated approval process."}, {"rank": 3, "idx": 63, "score": 0.549814, "title": "Degree Requirements - Degree Requirements - Dual Degrees", "url": "https://catalog.unh.edu/graduate/academic-regulations-degree-requirements/degree-requirements/", "tier": 1, "tier_name": "academic_regulations", "text": "Section: Degree Requirements - Degree Requirements - Dual Degrees\n\nAll standard policies relating to time to degree, residency requirements, academic standards, and minimum GPA required to graduate apply to any dual-­degree arrangement.

Under such an arrangement, a doctoral student completes the requirements of the Ph.D. program in both the home and partner university, conducts dissertation research collaboratively, sequentially, and for roughly equal amounts of time in both universities, and is supervised by a faculty member from each of the universities. The dissertation is then examined by a committee whose members are drawn from both institutions. A degree is awarded from each university with acknowledgment on the transcript of the cotutelle. All cotutelles must have a fully approved cotutelle agreement signed by multiple institutional representatives at both universities including the Office of International Students and Scholars (OISS).

A student may apply up to 12 credits earned in the first master's degree awarded at the University of New Hampshire toward a second master's degree with approval of the student's graduate advisory committee and/or graduate program coordinator in the second master's program. Thesis or research credits from the first program may not be counted toward the requirements of the second program. Concurrent Dual Degrees. Enrollment in concurrent dual degrees occurs when a student is admitted to and matriculated in two graduate degree programs at the University of New Hampshire simultaneously. A student may pursue concurrent degrees only with approval of the appropriate graduate program coordinator(s) and the dean of the Graduate School. With approval of the student's graduate advisory committee(s) and/or the graduate program coordinator(s), a student may apply up to 12 UNH credits earned in one master's degree toward the requirements for a second master's degree. A student must complete the capstone requirements for both programs. Completion of degree requirements for the two programs need not be at the same time. Integrated Dual Degrees. Integrated dual degrees occurs when two graduate programs have formalized a program of study which creates an integrated program linking the two disciplines, while continuing toward separate degrees. Students must be admitted to both programs and complete the requirements for both degrees. Integrated dual degree programs may include a single admissions process, submission of a single thesis or capstone experience, and a single advisory committee composed of members from both programs. The number of required credit hours for integrated dual degrees must not be less than 80 percent of the total minimum hours required to complete each degree separately.

Traditional full-time enrolled students will be able complete the degree in 18 months. UNH Bachelor's degree students entering into the Accelerated Master’s program as full time students will be able to complete their degree in as little as 12 months. Core Curriculum The MS Biotech:IBMS core curriculum is centered around research project team-based lab courses. This provides you with important industry-relevant transferrable job skills, such as clear communication, cooperation and relationship building, teamwork and conflict resolution, and creative problem-solving and strategic thinking. These transferrable skills are developed hand-in-hand with the wet-lab skills. In addition to the core lab and lecture coursework covering the major industry areas of cell, molecular, and protein biochemistry, the program incorporates a core course entitled “Biotechnology Products and Regulation.” This course takes a critical look at industry from the initial stages of research and development in the biomedical sciences through the legal and regulatory stages of biotechnology product development and manufacturing. This content is key to understanding how the biotech industry functions and thus is a centerpiece in your training in our degree program. Finally, you are required to enroll in a minimum of one graduate biotech seminar course. While the specific content of the seminar courses will vary to reflect the dynamics of the ever-changing biotech field, the two typical focus areas of the semester-long seminars will be “Instrumentation in the Biotech Industry” and “Cutting edge topics in the Biotech Industry today”. Elective Courses In addition to the Core requirements, you will develop a curriculum plan with your Faculty Advisor that includes elective courses. This curriculum plan will be customized to meet your career goals. While most students will likely choose elective courses offered in the Department of Life Sciences at UNH Manchester, the program welcomes you to enroll in courses in other UNH colleges in order to complete your elective requirements.

Up to 8 credits, upon recommendation of the department and approval of the Graduate School, may count towards both the bachelor's degree and a graduate certificate. For more information and a list of eligible programs, visit: https://gradschool.unh.edu/academics/accelerated-masters-program . Consecutive Master's Degrees. Enrollment in consecutive master's degrees refers to admission and matriculation in a second master's degree program at the University of New Hampshire after the completion of the requirements for a first master's degree earned at the University of New Hampshire. A student may apply up to 12 credits earned in the first master's degree awarded at the University of New Hampshire toward a second master's degree with approval of the student's graduate advisory committee and/or graduate program coordinator in the second master's program. Thesis or research credits from the first program may not be counted toward the requirements of the second program. Concurrent Dual Degrees. Enrollment in concurrent dual degrees occurs when a student is admitted to and matriculated in two graduate degree programs at the University of New Hampshire simultaneously. A student may pursue concurrent degrees only with approval of the appropriate graduate program coordinator(s) and the dean of the Graduate School. With approval of the student's graduate advisory committee(s) and/or the graduate program coordinator(s), a student may apply up to 12 UNH credits earned in one master's degree toward the requirements for a second master's degree. A student must complete the capstone requirements for both programs. Completion of degree requirements for the two programs need not be at the same time. Integrated Dual Degrees. Integrated dual degrees occurs when two graduate programs have formalized a program of study which creates an integrated program linking the two disciplines, while continuing toward separate degrees. Students must be admitted to both programs and complete the requirements for both degrees. Integrated dual degree programs may include a single admissions process, submission of a single thesis or capstone experience, and a single advisory committee composed of members from both programs. The number of required credit hours for integrated dual degrees must not be less than 80 percent of the total minimum hours required to complete each degree separately. Integrated dual degree programs must be approved by the Graduate Council and the dean of the Graduate School. Cotutelle Ph.D. Agreements with International Universities. A cotutelle is a Ph.D. jointly awarded by two universities from different countries. Under such an arrangement, a doctoral student completes the requirements of the Ph.D. program in both the home and partner university, conducts dissertation research collaboratively, sequentially, and for roughly equal amounts of time in both universities, and is supervised by a faculty member from each of the universities. The dissertation is then examined by a committee whose members are drawn from both institutions. A degree is awarded from each university with acknowledgment on the transcript of the cotutelle. All cotutelles must have a fully approved cotutelle agreement signed by multiple institutional representatives at both universities including the Office of International Students and Scholars (OISS). UNH faculty or students interested in developing a cotutelle should contact the Graduate School to get detailed instructions about what is required for a cotutelle agreement and the associated approval process."}, {"rank": 2, "idx": 3, "score": 0.54191, "title": "Academic Standards - Academic Standards - Academic Standards", "url": "https://catalog.unh.edu/graduate/academic-regulations-degree-requirements/academic-standards/", "tier": 1, "tier_name": "academic_regulations", "text": "Section: Academic Standards - Academic Standards - Academic Standards\n\nGraduate credit is only granted for courses completed with a grade of B-­ or higher.

Enrollment in consecutive master's degrees refers to admission and matriculation in a second master's degree program at the University of New Hampshire after the completion of the requirements for a first master's degree earned at the University of New Hampshire. A student may apply up to 12 credits earned in the first master's degree awarded at the University of New Hampshire toward a second master's degree with approval of the student's graduate advisory committee and/or graduate program coordinator in the second master's program. Thesis or research credits from the first program may not be counted toward the requirements of the second program. Concurrent Dual Degrees. Enrollment in concurrent dual degrees occurs when a student is admitted to and matriculated in two graduate degree programs at the University of New Hampshire simultaneously. A student may pursue concurrent degrees only with approval of the appropriate graduate program coordinator(s) and the dean of the Graduate School. With approval of the student's graduate advisory committee(s) and/or the graduate program coordinator(s), a student may apply up to 12 UNH credits earned in one master's degree toward the requirements for a second master's degree. A student must complete the capstone requirements for both programs. Completion of degree requirements for the two programs need not be at the same time. Integrated Dual Degrees. Integrated dual degrees occurs when two graduate programs have formalized a program of study which creates an integrated program linking the two disciplines, while continuing toward separate degrees. Students must be admitted to both programs and complete the requirements for both degrees. Integrated dual degree programs may include a single admissions process, submission of a single thesis or capstone experience, and a single advisory committee composed of members from both programs. The number of required credit hours for integrated dual degrees must not be less than 80 percent of the total minimum hours required to complete each degree separately. Integrated dual degree programs must be approved by the Graduate Council and the dean of the Graduate School. Cotutelle Ph.D. Agreements with International Universities. A cotutelle is a Ph.D. jointly awarded by two universities from different countries. Under such an arrangement, a doctoral student completes the requirements of the Ph.D. program in both the home and partner university, conducts dissertation research collaboratively, sequentially, and for roughly equal amounts of time in both universities, and is supervised by a faculty member from each of the universities. The dissertation is then examined by a committee whose members are drawn from both institutions. A degree is awarded from each university with acknowledgment on the transcript of the cotutelle. All cotutelles must have a fully approved cotutelle agreement signed by multiple institutional representatives at both universities including the Office of International Students and Scholars (OISS).

Students who have been admitted to the program may register for a maximum of 12 credits of 800-­level courses prior to completing their bachelor's degree. Such courses may, upon recommendation of the department and approval of the Graduate School, count toward both the bachelor's and master's degrees. Up to 8 credits, upon recommendation of the department and approval of the Graduate School, may count towards both the bachelor's degree and a graduate certificate. For more information and a list of eligible programs, visit: https://gradschool.unh.edu/academics/accelerated-masters-program . Consecutive Master's Degrees. Enrollment in consecutive master's degrees refers to admission and matriculation in a second master's degree program at the University of New Hampshire after the completion of the requirements for a first master's degree earned at the University of New Hampshire. A student may apply up to 12 credits earned in the first master's degree awarded at the University of New Hampshire toward a second master's degree with approval of the student's graduate advisory committee and/or graduate program coordinator in the second master's program. Thesis or research credits from the first program may not be counted toward the requirements of the second program. Concurrent Dual Degrees. Enrollment in concurrent dual degrees occurs when a student is admitted to and matriculated in two graduate degree programs at the University of New Hampshire simultaneously. A student may pursue concurrent degrees only with approval of the appropriate graduate program coordinator(s) and the dean of the Graduate School. With approval of the student's graduate advisory committee(s) and/or the graduate program coordinator(s), a student may apply up to 12 UNH credits earned in one master's degree toward the requirements for a second master's degree. A student must complete the capstone requirements for both programs. Completion of degree requirements for the two programs need not be at the same time. Integrated Dual Degrees. Integrated dual degrees occurs when two graduate programs have formalized a program of study which creates an integrated program linking the two disciplines, while continuing toward separate degrees. Students must be admitted to both programs and complete the requirements for both degrees. Integrated dual degree programs may include a single admissions process, submission of a single thesis or capstone experience, and a single advisory committee composed of members from both programs. The number of required credit hours for integrated dual degrees must not be less than 80 percent of the total minimum hours required to complete each degree separately. Integrated dual degree programs must be approved by the Graduate Council and the dean of the Graduate School. Cotutelle Ph.D. Agreements with International Universities. A cotutelle is a Ph.D. jointly awarded by two universities from different countries. Under such an arrangement, a doctoral student completes the requirements of the Ph.D. program in both the home and partner university, conducts dissertation research collaboratively, sequentially, and for roughly equal amounts of time in both universities, and is supervised by a faculty member from each of the universities. The dissertation is then examined by a committee whose members are drawn from both institutions. A degree is awarded from each university with acknowledgment on the transcript of the cotutelle. All cotutelles must have a fully approved cotutelle agreement signed by multiple institutional representatives at both universities including the Office of International Students and Scholars (OISS). UNH faculty or students interested in developing a cotutelle should contact the Graduate School to get detailed instructions about what is required for a cotutelle agreement and the associated approval process."}, {"rank": 2, "idx": 66, "score": 0.647215, "title": "Graduate Courses - Graduate Courses - 800 and 900­ Level Courses", "url": "https://catalog.unh.edu/graduate/academic-regulations-degree-requirements/courses/", "tier": 1, "tier_name": "academic_regulations", "text": "Section: Graduate Courses - Graduate Courses - 800 and 900­ Level Courses\n\n800-­ and 900­- level courses are offered for graduate credit only and therefore are open only to admitted graduate students or non­-degree students with a minimum of a bachelor’s degree."}, {"rank": 3, "idx": 46, "score": 0.593737, "title": "Degree Requirements - Degree Requirements - Master's Degree Requirements - Credits", "url": "https://catalog.unh.edu/graduate/academic-regulations-degree-requirements/degree-requirements/", "tier": 1, "tier_name": "academic_regulations", "text": "Section: Degree Requirements - Degree Requirements - Master's Degree Requirements - Credits\n\nA minimum of 30 graduate credits is required for all master's degrees.

Under such an arrangement, a doctoral student completes the requirements of the Ph.D. program in both the home and partner university, conducts dissertation research collaboratively, sequentially, and for roughly equal amounts of time in both universities, and is supervised by a faculty member from each of the universities. The dissertation is then examined by a committee whose members are drawn from both institutions. A degree is awarded from each university with acknowledgment on the transcript of the cotutelle. All cotutelles must have a fully approved cotutelle agreement signed by multiple institutional representatives at both universities including the Office of International Students and Scholars (OISS).

Integrated dual degrees occurs when two graduate programs have formalized a program of study which creates an integrated program linking the two disciplines, while continuing toward separate degrees. Students must be admitted to both programs and complete the requirements for both degrees. Integrated dual degree programs may include a single admissions process, submission of a single thesis or capstone experience, and a single advisory committee composed of members from both programs. The number of required credit hours for integrated dual degrees must not be less than 80 percent of the total minimum hours required to complete each degree separately. Integrated dual degree programs must be approved by the Graduate Council and the dean of the Graduate School. Cotutelle Ph.D. Agreements with International Universities. A cotutelle is a Ph.D. jointly awarded by two universities from different countries. Under such an arrangement, a doctoral student completes the requirements of the Ph.D. program in both the home and partner university, conducts dissertation research collaboratively, sequentially, and for roughly equal amounts of time in both universities, and is supervised by a faculty member from each of the universities. The dissertation is then examined by a committee whose members are drawn from both institutions. A degree is awarded from each university with acknowledgment on the transcript of the cotutelle. All cotutelles must have a fully approved cotutelle agreement signed by multiple institutional representatives at both universities including the Office of International Students and Scholars (OISS). UNH faculty or students interested in developing a cotutelle should contact the Graduate School to get detailed instructions about what is required for a cotutelle agreement and the associated approval process."}, {"rank": 6, "idx": 58, "score": 0.462364, "title": "Degree Requirements - Degree Requirements - Certificate Programs - CERTIFICATE TIME LIMIT", "url": "https://catalog.unh.edu/graduate/academic-regulations-degree-requirements/degree-requirements/", "tier": 1, "tier_name": "academic_regulations", "text": "Section: Degree Requirements - Degree Requirements - Certificate Programs - CERTIFICATE TIME LIMIT\n\nAll coursework for a certificate must be completed within 3 years from the date of matriculation (enrollment) in the program."}, {"rank": 7, "idx": 67, "score": 0.462124, "title": "Graduate Courses - Graduate Courses - 700 Level Courses", "url": "https://catalog.unh.edu/graduate/academic-regulations-degree-requirements/courses/", "tier": 1, "tier_name": "academic_regulations", "text": "Section: Graduate Courses - Graduate Courses - 700 Level Courses\n\n700-level courses are advanced undergraduate courses.

A student may apply up to 12 credits earned in the first master's degree awarded at the University of New Hampshire toward a second master's degree with approval of the student's graduate advisory committee and/or graduate program coordinator in the second master's program. Thesis or research credits from the first program may not be counted toward the requirements of the second program. Concurrent Dual Degrees. Enrollment in concurrent dual degrees occurs when a student is admitted to and matriculated in two graduate degree programs at the University of New Hampshire simultaneously.

With approval of the student's graduate advisory committee(s) and/or the graduate program coordinator(s), a student may apply up to 12 UNH credits earned in one master's degree toward the requirements for a second master's degree. A student must complete the capstone requirements for both programs. Completion of degree requirements for the two programs need not be at the same time. Integrated Dual Degrees. Integrated dual degrees occurs when two graduate programs have formalized a program of study which creates an integrated program linking the two disciplines, while continuing toward separate degrees. Students must be admitted to both programs and complete the requirements for both degrees. Integrated dual degree programs may include a single admissions process, submission of a single thesis or capstone experience, and a single advisory committee composed of members from both programs. The number of required credit hours for integrated dual degrees must not be less than 80 percent of the total minimum hours required to complete each degree separately.

To complete the degree, students must complete a research proposal, pass a qualifying exam, conduct dissertation research, and complete and defend a dissertation. Guidance and Dissertation Committees : During the first semester, the student and advisor jointly select members of a guidance committee. A nomination form must be sent to the graduate school to officially appoint the committee membership.

Committee members may approve or reject the written proposal. If a committee member rejects the submitted proposal, they must provide a response to the student, with copy to the advisor and other committee members. The response should articulate specific shortcomings and steps the student may take to rectify each of them. The advisor is responsible for reconvening the Committee to collectively assess the quality of the revised proposal. After the discussion, the committee will provide general comments and additional revision critiques specifying strengths and weaknesses of the proposal, as well as any necessary improvements that must be made by the student before proceeding with the research. After a majority of the members of the advisory committee has approved the written proposal, the student moves to complete the study and undertake the oral defense. Students are encouraged (although not a program requirement), in consultation with their advisor, to submit their research proposals to NIH or another appropriate agency to compete for a predoctoral fellowship. The oral section of the qualifying examination is contingent upon successful completion of the written section. The specific content of the oral exam is determined, in consultation with the Guidance Committee, primarily by the content of the written proposal. Students may give a brief update (~10 minutes) on their coursework and research progress at the beginning of the oral examination. The presentation of the research proposal may last 30-40 minutes, followed by questions from the committee. Questions may focus on general knowledge in neuroscience and behavior or focus on the proposed project. Students are expected to defend the significance, premise, rationale, methodologies, and experimental plans outlined in their proposal. The oral exam typically lasts 90-120 minutes. Upon the completion of questions from the committee, the student will be asked to leave the room while the Committee discusses the oral examination; the discussion should last no longer than 15 minutes, and result in consensus by the Committee. The student will then be invited back into the room to hear the Committee's decision and their specific feedback on both the oral portion of their exam and the qualifying exam in general."}], "transformed_query": "How do I sibmity my committee?"}
