Graduate part-time lecturers receive tuition waivers for the January term only if they are teaching during that term. The Graduate School provides graduate assistants, research assistants and fellows tuition waivers for summer courses offered through the Graduate School (GRAD) related to academic programs in College Teaching, Research Ethics and Grant Writing. Summer waivers are prorated for students who had less than a full academic year appointment. Graduate assistants, research assistants and fellows may receive tuition waivers for summer courses offered outside of the Graduate School if approved by their funding source. Such waivers are provided by the hiring unit. Research assistants must have a summer appointment to be eligible for grant-funded tuition waivers for the summer sessions. Waivers cover only course work that is directly related to a student’s academic program. Student Health Benefits Plan (SHBP): Students appointed as assistants, fellows and graduate part-time lecturers for the full academic year receive a waiver for the university’s Student Health Benefits Plan (SHBP) during the period of their appointment. Students on a fall only appointment and continuing in the graduate school for the spring semester full time receive a waiver for the SHBP for the fall and will be responsible for the spring portion of the plan costs. Students on a fall only appointment and continuing in the graduate school for the spring semester on a part time basis receive a waiver for the SHBP for the fall, have the option of continuing on the plan for the spring, and will be responsible for the spring portion of the plan costs.
