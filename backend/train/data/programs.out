Nutrition program is well-suited for students interested in pursuing subsequent
professional allied health pathways (e.g., medical school) or dietetic
internships that require a master’s degree for admittance. As part of the
program, students will demonstrate capacity to engage in critical and systems
thinking, convey and apply nutrition concepts, work as individuals and in teams,
and identify strategies for lifelong learning.

[4] Nutritional Sciences (M.S.): The program is for students who anticipate a
professional career involving research or discovery, with a strong background in
the basic biology and chemistry of nutrition. This degree may be most
appropriate for students who expect to pursue further advanced studies, e.g.,
additional graduate studies or professional school, after graduation. Graduates
of the Master of Science (M.S.) in Nutritional Sciences will be valued in the
marketplace as they will have a demonstrated capacity to engage in critical and
systems thinking, convey and apply nutrition concepts in clinical, research and
community settings, work as individuals and in teams, and identify strategies
for lifelong learning.

[5] Degrees Offered: M.S., Ph.D., and Graduate Certificate: At the Masters level,
students will engage in a research project related to the nutritional sciences
and gain a comprehensive understanding of nutritional science through
coursework. Students can earn a master's degree through three unique pathways:
M.S. in Nutritional Sciences, M.S. in Nutrition and Dietetics, and M.S. in
Nutrition. All three options emphasize active participation in hypothesis-driven
research of publishable quality.
