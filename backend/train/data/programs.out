[4] The Graduate School allows UNH students to pursue two degrees at UNH and count
credits toward both degrees under the circumstances detailed below. Such credit
will be granted only for graded coursework completed with a grade of "B-" or
higher. Application of such credit toward a student's program for a second
degree is subject to departmental recommendation and approval by the Graduate

same degree, or a combination of two different degrees. Students will receive
separate diplomas for each degree program. Note: Dual degrees will NOT be
awarded retroactively. Cotutelle Ph.D. Agreements with International
Universities. A cotutelle is a Ph.D. jointly awarded by two universities from
different countries. Under such an arrangement, a doctoral student completes the
requirements of the Ph.D. program in both the home and partner university,
conducts dissertation research collaboratively, sequentially, and for roughly
equal amounts of time in both universities, and is supervised by a faculty
member from each of the universities. The dissertation is then examined by a
committee whose members are drawn from both institutions. A degree is awarded
from each university with acknowledgment on the transcript of the cotutelle. All
cotutelles must have a fully approved cotutelle agreement signed by multiple
institutional representatives at both universities including the Office of
International Students and Scholars (OISS). UNH faculty or students interested
in developing a cotutelle should contact the Graduate School to get detailed
instructions about what is required for a cotutelle agreement and the associated
approval process. All standard policies relating to time to degree, residency
requirements, academic standards, and minimum GPA required to graduate apply to

credits toward both degrees under the circumstances detailed below. Such credit
will be granted only for graded coursework completed with a grade of "B-" or
higher. Application of such credit toward a student's program for a second
degree is subject to departmental recommendation and approval by the Graduate
School. Dual degrees should be interpreted to include separate majors within the
same degree, or a combination of two different degrees. Students will receive
separate diplomas for each degree program. Note: Dual degrees will NOT be
awarded retroactively. Cotutelle Ph.D. Agreements with International
Universities. A cotutelle is a Ph.D. jointly awarded by two universities from
different countries. Under such an arrangement, a doctoral student completes the
requirements of the Ph.D. program in both the home and partner university,
conducts dissertation research collaboratively, sequentially, and for roughly
equal amounts of time in both universities, and is supervised by a faculty
member from each of the universities. The dissertation is then examined by a
committee whose members are drawn from both institutions. A degree is awarded
from each university with acknowledgment on the transcript of the cotutelle. All
cotutelles must have a fully approved cotutelle agreement signed by multiple
institutional representatives at both universities including the Office of
International Students and Scholars (OISS). UNH faculty or students interested
in developing a cotutelle should contact the Graduate School to get detailed
instructions about what is required for a cotutelle agreement and the associated
approval process. All standard policies relating to time to degree, residency
requirements, academic standards, and minimum GPA required to graduate apply to
