degree program and taken prior to admission to the Ed.S., toward a Ed.S.
program. All graduate work for the Ed.S. degree must normally be completed
within four years from the date of matriculation.

[9] Grades: Section: Graduate Grading - Graduate Grading - Grades

[10] Audit Grades: An "AU" grade is assigned for completion of courses for which an
audit was granted. No credit is earned. Incomplete Grades: An "IC" grade is
assigned with the approval of the instructor for excused unfinished work only.
The work must be completed and submitted to the instructor by the date agreed
upon with the instructor, but not later than the last day of classes of the
semester immediately following the one in which the incomplete was granted
(800-­ and 900-level courses only; mid-semester deadline for 400-­, 500-, 600-,
and 700-­level courses). If extraordinary circumstances arise, a petition
requesting additional time may be submitted. The petition, listing a specific
deadline for completion, must be approved by the instructor, the student's
adviser, and graduate program coordinator before being submitted to the Graduate
School. An extension will be granted by the dean only under unusual
circumstances and will usually not exceed one calendar year from the end of the
semester in which the course was originally taken. An incomplete grade becomes
an "F" if not resolved or if a petition for an extension is not approved within
the allotted time period. This policy also applies to students who withdraw from
the University or who are on an approved leave of absence. IA Grades: "IA"
indicates "incomplete" in thesis credit, doctoral research, or other continuing
courses of more than one semester. The grade earned will replace the "IA" once
the work has been completed. In the case of doctoral research, once the
dissertation is deemed complete, only the final term of enrollment will be
assigned a "CR". Prior semester "IA" grades will remain on the official
transcript.

QUESTION:
Which engineering programs offer doctoral degrees?

ANSWER:
The University offers doctoral programs in those disciplines that have both the
faculty and facilities to support high ­quality advanced graduate education.

CONTEXT:
[1] Ed.D.: Section: Degree Requirements - Degree Requirements - Doctoral Degrees -
Ed.D.

[2] The degree of doctor of education is a terminal doctoral degree that prepares
students for careers in educational leadership. The program curriculum comprises
courses in educational policy, law, budget management, research methods, and
human resources, as well as a research-based capstone. Requirements for
completion of the Ed.D. are found under the program descriptions of the
Department of Education.

[3] Doctoral Programs: Section: Information and Policy - General Information -
Graduate Education - Doctoral Programs

[4] The University offers doctoral programs in those disciplines that have both the
faculty and facilities to support high ­quality advanced graduate education.
Care has also been taken to ensure that the programs will make a significant
contribution to the opportunities for doctoral education in the New England
region. Doctoral education properly focuses on preparing the student to
contribute to the growth of knowledge through research. Most doctoral programs
also provide opportunities for students to work as teaching assistants and to
participate in seminars on teaching led by experienced faculty members. After
receiving a dual grounding in the development and communication of knowledge,
graduates from UNH doctoral programs have gone on to pursue a wide range of
careers.

[5] Dual Degrees: Section: Degree Requirements - Degree Requirements - Dual Degrees

[6] The Graduate School allows UNH students to pursue two degrees at UNH and count
credits toward both degrees under the circumstances detailed below. Such credit
will be granted only for graded coursework completed with a grade of "B-" or
higher. Application of such credit toward a student's program for a second
degree is subject to departmental recommendation and approval by the Graduate
School. Dual degrees should be interpreted to include separate majors within the
same degree, or a combination of two different degrees. Students will receive
separate diplomas for each degree program. Note: Dual degrees will NOT be
awarded retroactively. Cotutelle Ph.D. Agreements with International
Universities. A cotutelle is a Ph.D. jointly awarded by two universities from
different countries. Under such an arrangement, a doctoral student completes the
requirements of the Ph.D. program in both the home and partner university,
conducts dissertation research collaboratively, sequentially, and for roughly
equal amounts of time in both universities, and is supervised by a faculty
member from each of the universities. The dissertation is then examined by a
committee whose members are drawn from both institutions. A degree is awarded
from each university with acknowledgment on the transcript of the cotutelle. All
cotutelles must have a fully approved cotutelle agreement signed by multiple
institutional representatives at both universities including the Office of
International Students and Scholars (OISS). UNH faculty or students interested
in developing a cotutelle should contact the Graduate School to get detailed
instructions about what is required for a cotutelle agreement and the associated
approval process. All standard policies relating to time to degree, residency
requirements, academic standards, and minimum GPA required to graduate apply to
any dual-­degree arrangement.

[7] Doctoral Committee: Section: Degree Requirements - Degree Requirements - Ph.D.
Candidacy - Doctoral Committee

[8] When a Ph.D. student advances to candidacy, a doctoral committee will be
appointed to supervise and pass on the dissertation and administer the final
examination. This committee will be nominated by the department of major
concentration and appointed by the dean of the Graduate School. It shall
normally consist of a minimum of five members, usually three from the major
department and two from related departments. The dean of the Graduate School is
an ex-officio member of all doctoral committees.

[9] Ph.D.: Section: Degree Requirements - Degree Requirements - Doctoral Degrees -
Ph.D.

[10] The degree of doctor of philosophy is conferred to qualified candidates who have
passed an oral or written examination(s) on the subject matter of their field of
study, who have completed an original investigation in this field, have embodied
the results in an acceptable dissertation, and who have passed an oral
examination in defense of the dissertation. The degree of doctor of philosophy
is essentially a research degree.

QUESTION:
Can I design my own interdisciplinary graduate program?

ANSWER:
The master of arts in liberal studies (M.A.L.S.) is an innovative,
interdisciplinary graduate program, intended to promote broad intellectual
comprehension and enrichment rather than vocational or professional training
within a single field or discipline.

CONTEXT:
[1] Interdisciplinary Programs: Section: Information and Policy - General
Information - Graduate Education - Interdisciplinary Programs

[2] The Graduate School encourages and supports interdisciplinary study within
existing programs and in the form of new and innovative graduate curricula.
While self­-designed courses of study are not available at the University, many
of our programs offer a range of electives, cross­-disciplinary study, and
independent projects that allow students to tailor their work to reflect
individual interests. This is especially true at the doctoral level. In
addition, the Graduate School oversees intercollegiate programs that involve
faculty and coursework from more than one school or college. Intercollegiate
programs offer students the opportunity to pursue new and emerging fields of
study that draw upon multiple disciplines, leading to solid disciplinary
foundations as well as cross­-disciplinary skills useful for solving new social
and scientific problems. Opportunities for interdisciplinary research are also
available in the institutes and centers at the University.

[3] Systems Design (Ph.D.): Section: Systems Design (Ph.D.) - Systems Design (Ph.D.)

[4] https://ceps.unh.edu/mechanical-engineering/program/phd/systems-design The
systems design doctoral degree is an interdepartmental program that addresses
contemporary engineering and scientific problems that can be solved only through
the cooperation of a variety of disciplines. Students in systems design can
elect one of two professional directions. The first develops professionals with
the technical expertise of a Ph.D. and with the ability to work with and direct
groups of people working on large-scale technical projects. The second direction
develops engineers with capabilities in the theory and analysis of large-scale
complex systems. Concentration in an area of specific individual interest is
combined with participation in a larger interdisciplinary project.

[5] Dual Degrees: Section: Degree Requirements - Degree Requirements - Dual Degrees

[6] The Graduate School allows UNH students to pursue two degrees at UNH and count
credits toward both degrees under the circumstances detailed below. Such credit
will be granted only for graded coursework completed with a grade of "B-" or
higher. Application of such credit toward a student's program for a second
degree is subject to departmental recommendation and approval by the Graduate
School. Dual degrees should be interpreted to include separate majors within the
same degree, or a combination of two different degrees. Students will receive
separate diplomas for each degree program. Note: Dual degrees will NOT be
awarded retroactively. Cotutelle Ph.D. Agreements with International
Universities. A cotutelle is a Ph.D. jointly awarded by two universities from
different countries. Under such an arrangement, a doctoral student completes the
requirements of the Ph.D. program in both the home and partner university,
conducts dissertation research collaboratively, sequentially, and for roughly
equal amounts of time in both universities, and is supervised by a faculty
member from each of the universities. The dissertation is then examined by a
committee whose members are drawn from both institutions. A degree is awarded
from each university with acknowledgment on the transcript of the cotutelle. All
cotutelles must have a fully approved cotutelle agreement signed by multiple
institutional representatives at both universities including the Office of
International Students and Scholars (OISS). UNH faculty or students interested
in developing a cotutelle should contact the Graduate School to get detailed
instructions about what is required for a cotutelle agreement and the associated
approval process. All standard policies relating to time to degree, residency
requirements, academic standards, and minimum GPA required to graduate apply to
any dual-­degree arrangement.

but drawing its courses and instructors from across the University, the program
makes available a diverse spectrum of offerings and a wealth of faculty
expertise and resources. The program addresses the particular interests of
students who seek to deepen their knowledge by designing their own challenging
but flexible program of cross-disciplinary learning. Admission Requirements
Admission to the master of arts in liberal studies is selective. A bachelor's
degree is required for admission. Students will be asked to provide relevant
transcripts of their educational experience, a resume, and letters of
recommendation. They will also be asked to submit a brief essay describing why
they are particularly interested in this program and indicating the sort of
interdisciplinary focus or area of learning in which they might like to
concentrate their study. The Graduate Record Exam (GRE) is not required but is
helpful.
