QUESTION:
What is the repeat rule for MARI 895?

ANSWER:
Grade Mode: Graduate Credit/Fail grading.

CONTEXT:
[1] [1] Grades: Graduate Grading - Grades

[2] Appeals: Every instructor must be prepared to discuss and explain the basis for
their evaluation of students. If, after consulting the instructor, a student
still believes that he or she was treated unfairly, he or she has the right to
seek redress from the chairperson of the department or program in which the
course is offered. Under exceptional circumstances, a final appeal may be made
to the dean of the college or school in which the program is offered. Repeated
courses: Repeating a course does not remove the original course or grade from
the record. If the course numbers and/or titles do not match exactly, graduate
students must obtain written permission of their adviser, graduate program
coordinator, and the endorsement of the Graduate School dean before the
adjustment will be made. Only the most recent grade is included in the
cumulative grade-­point average, and only the most recent credit, if any, is
included in the cumulative credits earned. A course may only be repeated once.
Only repeated courses taken at UNH will alter the cumulative grade-­point
average. Failing a required course for a second time is grounds for dismissal.

[3] [2] Grades: Graduate Grading - Grades

[4] Incomplete Grades: An "IC" grade is assigned with the approval of the instructor
for excused unfinished work only. The work must be completed and submitted to
the instructor by the date agreed upon with the instructor, but not later than
the last day of classes of the semester immediately following the one in which
the incomplete was granted (800-­ and 900-level courses only; mid-semester
deadline for 400-­, 500-, 600-, and 700-­level courses). If extraordinary
circumstances arise, a petition requesting additional time may be submitted. The
petition, listing a specific deadline for completion, must be approved by the
instructor, the student's adviser, and graduate program coordinator before being
submitted to the Graduate School. An extension will be granted by the dean only
under unusual circumstances and will usually not exceed one calendar year from
the end of the semester in which the course was originally taken. An incomplete
grade becomes an "F" if not resolved or if a petition for an extension is not
approved within the allotted time period. This policy also applies to students
who withdraw from the University or who are on an approved leave of absence. IA
Grades: "IA" indicates "incomplete" in thesis credit, doctoral research, or
other continuing courses of more than one semester. The grade earned will
replace the "IA" once the work has been completed. In the case of doctoral
research, once the dissertation is deemed complete, only the final term of
enrollment will be assigned a "CR". Prior semester "IA" grades will remain on
the official transcript.

[5] [3] Grades: Graduate Grading - Grades

[6] Audit Grades: An "AU" grade is assigned for completion of courses for which an
audit was granted. No credit is earned. Incomplete Grades: An "IC" grade is
assigned with the approval of the instructor for excused unfinished work only.
The work must be completed and submitted to the instructor by the date agreed
upon with the instructor, but not later than the last day of classes of the
semester immediately following the one in which the incomplete was granted
(800-­ and 900-level courses only; mid-semester deadline for 400-­, 500-, 600-,
and 700-­level courses). If extraordinary circumstances arise, a petition
requesting additional time may be submitted. The petition, listing a specific
deadline for completion, must be approved by the instructor, the student's
adviser, and graduate program coordinator before being submitted to the Graduate
School. An extension will be granted by the dean only under unusual
circumstances and will usually not exceed one calendar year from the end of the
semester in which the course was originally taken. An incomplete grade becomes
an "F" if not resolved or if a petition for an extension is not approved within
the allotted time period. This policy also applies to students who withdraw from
the University or who are on an approved leave of absence.

QUESTION:
What is the repeat rule for EDC 844?

ANSWER:
Grade Mode: Letter Grading.

CONTEXT:
[1] [1] Grades: Graduate Grading - Grades

[2] Appeals: Every instructor must be prepared to discuss and explain the basis for
their evaluation of students. If, after consulting the instructor, a student
still believes that he or she was treated unfairly, he or she has the right to
seek redress from the chairperson of the department or program in which the
course is offered. Under exceptional circumstances, a final appeal may be made
to the dean of the college or school in which the program is offered. Repeated
courses: Repeating a course does not remove the original course or grade from
the record. If the course numbers and/or titles do not match exactly, graduate
students must obtain written permission of their adviser, graduate program
coordinator, and the endorsement of the Graduate School dean before the
adjustment will be made. Only the most recent grade is included in the
cumulative grade-­point average, and only the most recent credit, if any, is
included in the cumulative credits earned. A course may only be repeated once.
Only repeated courses taken at UNH will alter the cumulative grade-­point
average. Failing a required course for a second time is grounds for dismissal.

[3] [2] Grades: Graduate Grading - Grades

[4] Incomplete Grades: An "IC" grade is assigned with the approval of the instructor
for excused unfinished work only. The work must be completed and submitted to
the instructor by the date agreed upon with the instructor, but not later than
the last day of classes of the semester immediately following the one in which
the incomplete was granted (800-­ and 900-level courses only; mid-semester
deadline for 400-­, 500-, 600-, and 700-­level courses). If extraordinary
circumstances arise, a petition requesting additional time may be submitted. The
petition, listing a specific deadline for completion, must be approved by the
instructor, the student's adviser, and graduate program coordinator before being
submitted to the Graduate School. An extension will be granted by the dean only
under unusual circumstances and will usually not exceed one calendar year from
the end of the semester in which the course was originally taken. An incomplete
grade becomes an "F" if not resolved or if a petition for an extension is not
approved within the allotted time period. This policy also applies to students
who withdraw from the University or who are on an approved leave of absence. IA
Grades: "IA" indicates "incomplete" in thesis credit, doctoral research, or
other continuing courses of more than one semester. The grade earned will
replace the "IA" once the work has been completed. In the case of doctoral
research, once the dissertation is deemed complete, only the final term of
enrollment will be assigned a "CR". Prior semester "IA" grades will remain on
the official transcript.

[5] [3] Attendance: Attendance

[6] Excused absences Specific attendance requirements including how individual
faculty assess absences and designate excused absences are set by the course
instructor based on the needs of the course. Individual course attendance
policies are described in the course syllabus. Students should contact their
faculty regarding any circumstances, including illness, which will require them
to stay home and/or which will cause them to be unable to keep up with course
activities and expectations. Students should also be prepared to reach out and
proactively ask faculty if they are unsure of what is expected of them in the
course, as related to their absences or in general.

QUESTION:
What's the repeat rule for JUST 899?

ANSWER:
Students who are not enrolled for course credits are required to register for
GRAD 800 Continuing Enrollment each semester of the academic year (or each
summer for students in M.S.T programs).

CONTEXT:
[1] [1] Grades: Graduate Grading - Grades

[2] Appeals: Every instructor must be prepared to discuss and explain the basis for
their evaluation of students. If, after consulting the instructor, a student
still believes that he or she was treated unfairly, he or she has the right to
seek redress from the chairperson of the department or program in which the
course is offered. Under exceptional circumstances, a final appeal may be made
to the dean of the college or school in which the program is offered. Repeated
courses: Repeating a course does not remove the original course or grade from
the record. If the course numbers and/or titles do not match exactly, graduate
students must obtain written permission of their adviser, graduate program
coordinator, and the endorsement of the Graduate School dean before the
adjustment will be made. Only the most recent grade is included in the
cumulative grade-­point average, and only the most recent credit, if any, is
included in the cumulative credits earned. A course may only be repeated once.
Only repeated courses taken at UNH will alter the cumulative grade-­point
average. Failing a required course for a second time is grounds for dismissal.
