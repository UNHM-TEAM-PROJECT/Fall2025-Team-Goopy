Can I transfer credits from another university to my graduate program?

ANSWER:
Students who wish to take a course at another university, with the intention of
transferring, should obtain the approval of their advisor and graduate school
prior to enrolling in the course to ensure that they meet the transfer
requirements.

CONTEXT:
[1] External to UNH: The transfer credit request must be recommended by the program
faculty and approved by the Graduate School. Current UNH graduate students who
wish to take a course at another university, with the intention of transferring,
should obtain the approval of their advisor and graduate school prior to
enrolling in the course to ensure that the course meets the transfer
requirements.

[2] External to UNH: Students may request that a maximum of two courses, for up to 8
credits of graduate level coursework, from an accredited institution authorized
to grant graduate degrees, be transferred to count toward their graduate
program. Courses must be at the graduate level and cannot have been used or be
in the process of being used in earning another graduate degree or certificate
or have been taken while completing a bachelor's degree. A grade of B or better
must have been earned. Students must submit an External Transfer Credit Form to
request that the credits be applied to their degree requirements.

[3] Credit Transfer: A maximum of 12 credits taken by a student prior to
matriculation (internal and external combined) can be applied to a degree
program. Transfer credits must be formally approved and appear on the UNH
transcript in order for them to count towards the degree requirements.

applied to their degree requirements.

================================================================================

QUESTION:
What happens if I miss too many classes?

ANSWER:
Students are not penalized for missed assignments or missed class. In these
cases, faculty have discretion regarding what flexibility to offer based on
their syllabus policies. If a student is called for required military service or
jury duty that will cause them to miss class for an extended period and render
them unable to adequately fulfill the standards and requirements of the course
as determined by the instructor.

CONTEXT:
[1] Attendance: Reasons that faculty must excuse student absences are: (a)
participation in official intercollegiate events, (b) participation in official
adaptive sports events facilitated by Northeast Passage, (c) jury duty, (d)
required military service, and (e) important religious holidays and/or
observances. In these cases, it is expected that students are not penalized for
missed assignments or missed class. Faculty may still set expectations regarding
how students make up missed work and learn missed content. Faculty may also
request documentation regarding official intercollegiate events, required
military service, and jury duty. If a student is called for required military
service or jury duty that will cause them to miss class for an extended period
and render them unable to adequately fulfill the standards and requirements of
the course as determined by the instructor, that student should contact the
associate dean of the Graduate School to discuss options to drop or withdraw.

[2] Attendance: Reasons that faculty may excuse student absences include: (a) ill
health, (b) personal emergencies, and (c) instructional trips, and (d) when
students are representing UNH in regional, national, and international academic-
related opportunities. In these cases, faculty have discretion regarding what
flexibility to offer based on their syllabus policies. Students may contact the
Dean of Students if they’re managing a temporary, extenuating circumstance that
will affect their academics for an ongoing period to request that a notice be
sent to their faculty. These notices will not be sent in situations where
students are missing only one or two days of class.

[3] Grades: Repeated courses: Repeating a course does not remove the original course
or grade from the record. If the course numbers and/or titles do not match
exactly, graduate students must obtain written permission of their adviser,
graduate program coordinator, and the endorsement of the Graduate School dean
before the adjustment will be made. Only the most recent grade is included in
the cumulative grade-­point average, and only the most recent credit, if any, is
included in the cumulative credits earned. A course may only be repeated once.
Only repeated courses taken at UNH will alter the cumulative grade-­point
average. Failing a required course for a second time is grounds for dismissal.

[4] Attendance: Specific attendance requirements including how individual faculty
assess absences and designate excused absences are set by the course instructor
based on the needs of the course. Individual course attendance policies are
described in the course syllabus. Students should contact their faculty
regarding any circumstances, including illness, which will require them to stay
home and/or which will cause them to be unable to keep up with course activities
and expectations. Students should also be prepared to reach out and proactively
ask faculty if they are unsure of what is expected of them in the course, as
related to their absences or in general.

[5] Attendance: Any student who is absent without excuse from an announced test,
quiz, examination, or laboratory period may, at the discretion of the
instructor, be penalized for such absence or be allowed to make up the work
missed.

QUESTION:
What's the difference between an M.S. and M.A. degree?

ANSWER:
The M.A.T. requires that at least three graduate-level courses (9-12 graduate
credits) be in an area of subject matter concentration rather than in education.
Students who have previously completed a baccalaureate degree at UNH or another
institution may also apply to the teacher preparation program at the graduate
level.

CONTEXT:
[1] Sociology (M.A.): The master's program emphasizes Sociological theory and
methods. Some students earn the M.A. to prepare for positions as applied
sociologists. Their work often includes field experience. Others view the M.A.
degree as preparation for Ph.D. studies. An M.A. thesis or publishable paper
describes results from the student's own original research.

[2] Secondary Education (M.A.T.): What is the difference between an M.Ed. and the
M.A.T in Secondary Education? The M.A.T. requires that at least three graduate-
level courses (9-12 graduate credits) be in an area of subject matter
concentration rather than in education. UNH undergraduates completing a
baccalaureate degree outside of education who are interested in the M.Ed. or
M.A.T. in Secondary Education can begin preparation for teaching at the
undergraduate level with a semester of field experience and professional course
work in education. In their second semester junior year or first semester senior
year, qualified students can apply to the Accelerated Master’s Program . If
accepted, they can potentially complete both their bachelor’s and master’s
degrees in as few as five years. Students who have previously completed a
baccalaureate degree at UNH or another institution may also apply to the teacher
preparation program at the graduate level. Without prior course work in
education, these programs will normally require two years to achieve licensure
and a degree.

[3] Secondary Education (M.Ed.): What is the difference between an M.Ed. and the
M.A.T in Secondary Education? The M.A.T. requires that at least three graduate-
level courses (9-12 graduate credits) be in an area of subject matter
concentration rather than in education. UNH undergraduates completing a
baccalaureate degree outside of education who are interested in the M.Ed. or
M.A.T. in Secondary Education can begin preparation for teaching at the
undergraduate level with a semester of field experience and professional course
work in education. In their second semester junior year or first semester senior
year, qualified students can apply to the Accelerated Master’s Program . If
accepted, they can potentially complete both their bachelor’s and master’s
degrees in as few as five years. Students who have previously completed a
baccalaureate degree at UNH or another institution may also apply to the teacher
preparation program at the graduate level. Without prior course work in
education, these programs will normally require two years to achieve licensure
and a degree.

[4] Degrees Offered: Ph.D., M.S.: The M.S. program provides students with the
opportunity to develop a high degree of proficiency in a specialized research
area. The program builds a solid foundation for careers in industry or teaching,
for further graduate or professional school, or for those who would like to
strengthen their Chemistry knowledge.

[5] Physics (M.S.): The Physics M.S. program prepares students for a career in
industry, education, or government. The curriculum encompassing core areas of
physics as well as elective classes that can be chosen to match their area of
interest. The M.S. degree includes a capstone experience, which can be a
Master's Thesis or a Master's project (for students in the PhD program, the oral
thesis proposal satisfies the capstone requirement).

observances. In these cases, it is expected that students are not penalized for
missed assignments or missed class. Faculty may still set expectations regarding
how students make up missed work and learn missed content. Faculty may also
request documentation regarding official intercollegiate events, required
military service, and jury duty. If a student is called for required military
service or jury duty that will cause them to miss class for an extended period
and render them unable to adequately fulfill the standards and requirements of
the course as determined by the instructor, that student should contact the
associate dean of the Graduate School to discuss options to drop or withdraw.

[4] Attendance: Specific attendance requirements including how individual faculty
assess absences and designate excused absences are set by the course instructor
based on the needs of the course. Individual course attendance policies are
described in the course syllabus. Students should contact their faculty
regarding any circumstances, including illness, which will require them to stay
home and/or which will cause them to be unable to keep up with course activities
and expectations. Students should also be prepared to reach out and proactively
ask faculty if they are unsure of what is expected of them in the course, as
related to their absences or in general.
