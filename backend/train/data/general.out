QUESTION:
What happens if I miss too many classes?

ANSWER:
Students are expected to accept the responsibility for satisfactory attendance
in each course for which they are registered. The grade earned will replace the
"IA" once the work has been completed. In the case of doctoral research, if the
dissertation is deemed complete, only the final term of enrollment will be
assigned a "CR". Prior semester IA grades will remain on the official
transcript. NR Grades: "NR" indicates "Not Resolved: pending academic integrity

personal emergencies, and (c) instructional trips, and (d) when students are
representing UNH in regional, national, and international academic-related
opportunities. In these cases, faculty have discretion regarding what
flexibility to offer based on their syllabus policies. Students may contact the
Dean of Students if they’re managing a temporary, extenuating circumstance that
will affect their academics for an ongoing period to request that a notice be
sent to their faculty. These notices will not be sent in situations where
students are missing only one or two days of class. Reasons that faculty must
excuse student absences are: (a) participation in official intercollegiate
events, (b) participation in official adaptive sports events facilitated by
Northeast Passage, (c) jury duty, (d) required military service, and (e)
important religious holidays and/or observances. In these cases, it is expected
that students are not penalized for missed assignments or missed class. Faculty
may still set expectations regarding how students make up missed work and learn
missed content. Faculty may also request documentation regarding official
intercollegiate events, required military service, and jury duty. If a student
is called for required military service or jury duty that will cause them to
miss class for an extended period and render them unable to adequately fulfill
the standards and requirements of the course as determined by the instructor,
that student should contact the associate dean of the Graduate School to discuss
options to drop or withdraw. Absence on voting day

[3] Attendance: Section: Attendance - Attendance

policies are described in the course syllabus. Students should contact their
faculty regarding any circumstances, including illness, which will require them
to stay home and/or which will cause them to be unable to keep up with course
activities and expectations. Students should also be prepared to reach out and
proactively ask faculty if they are unsure of what is expected of them in the
course, as related to their absences or in general. Reasons that faculty may
excuse student absences include: (a) ill health, (b) personal emergencies, and
(c) instructional trips, and (d) when students are representing UNH in regional,
national, and international academic-related opportunities. In these cases,

research, once the dissertation is deemed complete, only the final term of
enrollment will be assigned a "CR". Prior semester "IA" grades will remain on
the official transcript. NR Grades: "NR" indicates "Not Resolved: pending
academic integrity allegation". W Grades: If a student, for compelling
nonacademic reasons, submits an approved petition to drop a course during the
withdrawal period, a notation of "W" will be shown on the student's academic
record. The specific withdrawal deadlines can be found on the UNH Academic
Calendar. Failure to officially withdraw will result in an AF grade, which is
maintained on the official student record and included in the grade point

syllabi. Students must be enrolled in the 800 level of the course in order to
obtain graduate credit.

[7] Grades: Section: Graduate Grading - Graduate Grading - Grades

[8] Audit Grades: An "AU" grade is assigned for completion of courses for which an
audit was granted. No credit is earned. Incomplete Grades: An "IC" grade is
assigned with the approval of the instructor for excused unfinished work only.
The work must be completed and submitted to the instructor by the date agreed
upon with the instructor, but not later than the last day of classes of the
semester immediately following the one in which the incomplete was granted
(800-­ and 900-level courses only; mid-semester deadline for 400-­, 500-, 600-,
and 700-­level courses). If extraordinary circumstances arise, a petition
requesting additional time may be submitted. The petition, listing a specific
deadline for completion, must be approved by the instructor, the student's
adviser, and graduate program coordinator before being submitted to the Graduate
School. An extension will be granted by the dean only under unusual
circumstances and will usually not exceed one calendar year from the end of the
semester in which the course was originally taken. An incomplete grade becomes
an "F" if not resolved or if a petition for an extension is not approved within
the allotted time period. This policy also applies to students who withdraw from
the University or who are on an approved leave of absence. IA Grades: "IA"
indicates "incomplete" in thesis credit, doctoral research, or other continuing
courses of more than one semester. The grade earned will replace the "IA" once
the work has been completed. In the case of doctoral research, once the

constitute an automatic withdrawal. Appeals: Every instructor must be prepared
to discuss and explain the basis for their evaluation of students. If, after
consulting the instructor, a student still believes that he or she was treated
unfairly, he or she has the right to seek redress from the chairperson of the
department or program in which the course is offered. Under exceptional
circumstances, a final appeal may be made to the dean of the college or school
in which the program is offered. Repeated courses: Repeating a course does not
remove the original course or grade from the record. If the course numbers
and/or titles do not match exactly, graduate students must obtain written
permission of their adviser, graduate program coordinator, and the endorsement
of the Graduate School dean before the adjustment will be made. Only the most
recent grade is included in the cumulative grade-­point average, and only the
most recent credit, if any, is included in the cumulative credits earned. A
course may only be repeated once. Only repeated courses taken at UNH will alter
the cumulative grade-­point average. Failing a required course for a second time
is grounds for dismissal.

[2] W Grades: If a student, for compelling nonacademic reasons, submits an approved
petition to drop a course during the withdrawal period, a notation of "W" will
be shown on the student's academic record. The specific withdrawal deadlines can
be found on the UNH Academic Calendar. Failure to officially withdraw will
result in an AF grade, which is maintained on the official student record and
included in the grade point average (GPA). Not attending classes does not
constitute an automatic withdrawal. Appeals: Every instructor must be prepared
to discuss and explain the basis for their evaluation of students. If, after
consulting the instructor, a student still believes that he or she was treated
unfairly, he or she has the right to seek redress from the chairperson of the
department or program in which the course is offered. Under exceptional
circumstances, a final appeal may be made to the dean of the college or school
in which the program is offered. Repeated courses: Repeating a course does not
remove the original course or grade from the record. If the course numbers
and/or titles do not match exactly, graduate students must obtain written
permission of their adviser, graduate program coordinator, and the endorsement
of the Graduate School dean before the adjustment will be made. Only the most
recent grade is included in the cumulative grade-­point average, and only the
most recent credit, if any, is included in the cumulative credits earned. A
course may only be repeated once. Only repeated courses taken at UNH will alter
the cumulative grade-­point average. Failing a required course for a second time
is grounds for dismissal.

other continuing courses of more than one semester. The grade earned will
replace the "IA" once the work has been completed. In the case of doctoral
research, once the dissertation is deemed complete, only the final term of
enrollment will be assigned a "CR". Prior semester "IA" grades will remain on
the official transcript. NR Grades: "NR" indicates "Not Resolved: pending
academic integrity allegation". W Grades: If a student, for compelling
nonacademic reasons, submits an approved petition to drop a course during the
withdrawal period, a notation of "W" will be shown on the student's academic
record. The specific withdrawal deadlines can be found on the UNH Academic
Calendar. Failure to officially withdraw will result in an AF grade, which is

QUESTION:
What happens if I get an incomplete grade?

ANSWER:
An incomplete grade becomes an "F" if not resolved or a petition for an
extension is not approved within the allotted time period. This policy also
applies to students who withdraw from the University or who are on an approved
leave of absence.

CONTEXT:
[1] Grades: Section: Graduate Grading - Graduate Grading - Grades

[2] Audit Grades: An "AU" grade is assigned for completion of courses for which an
audit was granted. No credit is earned. Incomplete Grades: An "IC" grade is
assigned with the approval of the instructor for excused unfinished work only.
The work must be completed and submitted to the instructor by the date agreed
upon with the instructor, but not later than the last day of classes of the
semester immediately following the one in which the incomplete was granted
(800-­ and 900-level courses only; mid-semester deadline for 400-­, 500-, 600-,
and 700-­level courses). If extraordinary circumstances arise, a petition
requesting additional time may be submitted. The petition, listing a specific
deadline for completion, must be approved by the instructor, the student's
adviser, and graduate program coordinator before being submitted to the Graduate
School. An extension will be granted by the dean only under unusual
circumstances and will usually not exceed one calendar year from the end of the
semester in which the course was originally taken. An incomplete grade becomes
an "F" if not resolved or if a petition for an extension is not approved within
the allotted time period. This policy also applies to students who withdraw from
the University or who are on an approved leave of absence. IA Grades: "IA"
indicates "incomplete" in thesis credit, doctoral research, or other continuing
courses of more than one semester. The grade earned will replace the "IA" once
the work has been completed. In the case of doctoral research, once the
dissertation is deemed complete, only the final term of enrollment will be
assigned a "CR". Prior semester "IA" grades will remain on the official
transcript.

Simultaneous 700/800 Courses

[2] 800-­level courses may be cross-­listed with 700-­level courses and taught
simultaneously to both graduate and undergraduate students. While the content of
the course is the same, the requirements and expectations of the students differ
substantially with assignments, examinations, and projects demonstrating a
broader depth of understanding, sophistication and skills for students enrolled
at the 800 ­level. The method of assessing graduate student demonstration of a
higher level of understanding and skill is made clear to students on course
syllabi. Students must be enrolled in the 800 level of the course in order to
obtain graduate credit.

[3] Graduate Courses: Section: Graduate Courses - Graduate Courses

[4] Graduate credits may be earned in courses numbered from 800 through 999, or
under limited circumstances in courses numbered at the 700 level. The faculty of
each graduate program prescribes the courses that make up the degree program. In
addition, the Graduate School has general requirements for master's and doctoral

ANSWER:
Students who are absent without excuse from an announced test, quiz,
examination, or laboratory period may be penalized for missed assignments or
missed class. Faculty are requested to cooperate to the fullest extent with
students from communities scheduling elections at other times. In these cases,
faculty have discretion regarding what flexibility to offer based on their
syllabus policies. Students may contact the Dean of Students if they’re managing
a temporary, extenuating circumstance that will affect their academics for an
ongoing period to request that an notice be sent to their faculty. These notices
will not be delivered in situations where students are missing only one or two

CONTEXT:
[1] Attendance: Section: Attendance - Attendance

[2] Absence on voting day In order that UNH students may fully exercise their
constitutional right to vote in New Hampshire state and federal elections, no
examinations will be scheduled on the first Tuesday of November, and such should
be designated in the University calendars. Opportunities for makeup of other
scheduled exercises on those days should be provided where necessary. Faculty
are requested to cooperate to the fullest extent with students from communities
scheduling elections at other times.

[3] Examinations: Section: Graduate Grading - Graduate Grading - Examinations

[4] Examinations at the end of each semester may be given in any course, but all
such examinations must be scheduled and given at the time they are scheduled
with the following exceptions: practical examinations covering laboratory work
may be given during the last five days of classes preceding the examination
period. In courses of a modular nature with several instructors, the instructor
of the final module may schedule a final examination during the last week of
classes if approval is first obtained from the college dean. These exceptions
apart, no announced oral or written test may be given during the last five days
of classes preceding the examination period. If a student is scheduled for more
than two final exams in one day and chooses to take only two final exams on that
day, the middle exam will be rescheduled. The instructor, in consultation with
the student, will schedule a makeup exam.

opportunities. In these cases, faculty have discretion regarding what
flexibility to offer based on their syllabus policies. Students may contact the
Dean of Students if they’re managing a temporary, extenuating circumstance that
will affect their academics for an ongoing period to request that a notice be
sent to their faculty. These notices will not be sent in situations where
students are missing only one or two days of class. Reasons that faculty must
excuse student absences are: (a) participation in official intercollegiate
events, (b) participation in official adaptive sports events facilitated by
Northeast Passage, (c) jury duty, (d) required military service, and (e)
important religious holidays and/or observances. In these cases, it is expected
that students are not penalized for missed assignments or missed class. Faculty
may still set expectations regarding how students make up missed work and learn
missed content. Faculty may also request documentation regarding official
intercollegiate events, required military service, and jury duty. If a student
is called for required military service or jury duty that will cause them to
miss class for an extended period and render them unable to adequately fulfill
the standards and requirements of the course as determined by the instructor,
that student should contact the associate dean of the Graduate School to discuss
options to drop or withdraw. Absence on voting day

Students should contact their faculty regarding any circumstances, including
illness, that will require them to stay home and/or which will result in them
being unable to keep up with course activities and expectations. In these cases,
it is expected that students are not penalized for missed assignments or missed
class. Faculty may still set expectations regarding how students make up missed

assigned with the approval of the instructor for excused unfinished work only.
The work must be completed and submitted to the instructor by the date agreed
upon with the instructor, but not later than the last day of classes of the
semester immediately following the one in which the incomplete was granted
(800-­ and 900-level courses only; mid-semester deadline for 400-­, 500-, 600-,
and 700-­level courses). If extraordinary circumstances arise, a petition
requesting additional time may be submitted. The petition, listing a specific
deadline for completion, must be approved by the instructor, the student's
adviser, and graduate program coordinator before being submitted to the Graduate
School. An extension will be granted by the dean only under unusual
circumstances and will usually not exceed one calendar year from the end of the
semester in which the course was originally taken. An incomplete grade becomes
an "F" if not resolved or if a petition for an extension is not approved within
the allotted time period. This policy also applies to students who withdraw from
the University or who are on an approved leave of absence. IA Grades: "IA"
indicates "incomplete" in thesis credit, doctoral research, or other continuing
courses of more than one semester. The grade earned will replace the "IA" once
the work has been completed. In the case of doctoral research, once the
dissertation is deemed complete, only the final term of enrollment will be
assigned a "CR". Prior semester "IA" grades will remain on the official
transcript.

QUESTION:
If I miss an assignment due to jury duty, will I be penalized?

ANSWER:
In these cases, it is expected that students are not penalized for missed

be shown on the student's academic record. The specific withdrawal deadlines can
be found on the UNH Academic Calendar. Failure to officially withdraw will
result in an AF grade, which is maintained on the official student record and
included in the grade point average (GPA). Not attending classes does not
constitute an automatic withdrawal. Appeals: Every instructor must be prepared
to discuss and explain the basis for their evaluation of students. If, after
consulting the instructor, a student still believes that he or she was treated
unfairly, he or she has the right to seek redress from the chairperson of the
department or program in which the course is offered. Under exceptional
circumstances, a final appeal may be made to the dean of the college or school
in which the program is offered. Repeated courses: Repeating a course does not
remove the original course or grade from the record. If the course numbers
and/or titles do not match exactly, graduate students must obtain written
permission of their adviser, graduate program coordinator, and the endorsement
of the Graduate School dean before the adjustment will be made. Only the most
recent grade is included in the cumulative grade-­point average, and only the
most recent credit, if any, is included in the cumulative credits earned. A
course may only be repeated once. Only repeated courses taken at UNH will alter
the cumulative grade-­point average. Failing a required course for a second time

QUESTION:
Can I take classes while my academic dismissal appeal is being reviewed?

ANSWER:
Generally, dismissed students will not be able to continue in classes pending
the outcome of the appeal. This procedure is not applicable to graduate students
who have received failing grades in 9 or more credits since dismissal is
automatic in that case (see Academic Standards section).

CONTEXT:
[1] Appeals Process: Section: Academic Standards - Academic Standards - Policy and
Procedure for Program Dismissals - Appeals Process

[2] To appeal a dismissal decision, a student must submit a letter and any
supporting documents to the program chairperson and the dean of the Graduate
School within ten (10) business days of the dismissal notification. The appeal
should provide specific evidence, context, or mitigating factors that the
student believes should be considered in reviewing the decision. The appeal
should refer specifically to the grounds of the original decision in making this
appeal and provide reference to relevant policy where applicable. Generally,
dismissed students will not be able to continue in classes pending the outcome
of the appeal, but the program chairperson may make a final decision regarding
if the student can continue in the program pending the appellate review or
continue with conditions. Program Level Appeal – The program chairperson will
review the appeal, solicit input from all other graduate faculty in the program,
and re-evaluate the decision based on the additional information provided by the
student and feedback from the program graduate faculty. The program chairperson
will provide the student and the dean of the Graduate School with written
notification of their decision to either uphold or overturn the dismissal,
normally within 20 days of the receipt of the student’s appeals letter. Graduate
Level Appeal – If the student is dissatisfied with the decision reached by the
program chairperson, they may request that the dean of the Graduate School
review the decision, normally within seven (7) business days after the receipt
of the appellate decision reached by the program chairperson. The dean of the
Graduate School will review the appeal documents and decide whether the appeal
will continue to move forward. If the Dean determines that the appeal will not
move forward, they will communicate their decision and the rationale for their
decision to the student with copies to the graduate program coordinator and
chairperson and the process ends there. If the Dean determines that the appeal
will continue forward, they will notify the parties accordingly and act as chair
in convening an individual or group from the Graduate Council Student Affairs
Committee (GCSAC) to review the appeal. The appeals panel can solicit additional
information from the student, program, or others associated with the case as
needed. The appeals panel will then make a final determination regarding whether
to uphold or overturn the dismissal, normally within 20 days of receiving the
appeal. In extraordinary circumstances, the Dean may call the appeals panel back
together or overturn the decision of the panel. Otherwise, decisions made by the
panel are final and non-reviewable.

Continuing Education Units

[10] The Continuing Education Unit (CEU) is a nationally recognized method of
quantifying the time spent in the classroom during professional development and
training activities. Ten hours of instruction = 1.0 CEU. One hour of instruction
= 0.1 CEU. CEUs are not transferable as graduate credit.

QUESTION:
Can a student pursue concurrent dual degrees?

ANSWER:
Integrated dual degrees occur when a student is admitted to and matriculated in
two graduate degree programs at the University of New Hampshire simultaneously.
A student may pursue concurrent degrees only with approval of the appropriate
graduate program coordinator(s) and the dean of their Graduate School.

CONTEXT:
[1] Dual Degrees: Section: Degree Requirements - Degree Requirements - Dual Degrees

[2] All standard policies relating to time to degree, residency requirements,
academic standards, and minimum GPA required to graduate apply to any
dual-­degree arrangement. If the student withdraws from one of the participating
programs, the dual-degree arrangement is automatically nullified. If a student's
tuition is funded by one or more units, it is up to the funding unit to decide
if tuition may cover courses taken solely for completion of the second program.

[4] The Graduate School allows UNH students to pursue two degrees at UNH and count
credits toward both degrees under the circumstances detailed below. Such credit
will be granted only for graded coursework completed with a grade of "B-" or
higher. Application of such credit toward a student's program for a second
degree is subject to departmental recommendation and approval by the Graduate
School. Dual degrees should be interpreted to include separate majors within the
same degree, or a combination of two different degrees. Students will receive
separate diplomas for each degree program. Note: Dual degrees will NOT be
awarded retroactively. Cotutelle Ph.D. Agreements with International
Universities. A cotutelle is a Ph.D. jointly awarded by two universities from
different countries. Under such an arrangement, a doctoral student completes the
requirements of the Ph.D. program in both the home and partner university,
conducts dissertation research collaboratively, sequentially, and for roughly
equal amounts of time in both universities, and is supervised by a faculty
member from each of the universities. The dissertation is then examined by a
committee whose members are drawn from both institutions. A degree is awarded
from each university with acknowledgment on the transcript of the cotutelle. All
cotutelles must have a fully approved cotutelle agreement signed by multiple
institutional representatives at both universities including the Office of
International Students and Scholars (OISS). UNH faculty or students interested
in developing a cotutelle should contact the Graduate School to get detailed
instructions about what is required for a cotutelle agreement and the associated
approval process. All standard policies relating to time to degree, residency
requirements, academic standards, and minimum GPA required to graduate apply to
any dual-­degree arrangement.

[5] Academic Standards: Section: Academic Standards - Academic Standards - Academic
Standards

[6] Graduate credit is only granted for courses completed with a grade of B-­ or
higher. Individual programs may have stricter requirements, and those are
published with their degree program requirements. Graduate students receiving
grades below "B-­" in 9 or more credits , including undergraduate courses taken
while a graduate student, will be dismissed from the Graduate School. 1 Graduate
students enrolled under the accelerated master's program receiving any grade
below "B-­" in a graduate course while in dual status may be dismissed and have
their admission to the Graduate School withdrawn. Graduate students will have a
maximum of two opportunities to successfully complete final examinations for the
master's or Ed.S. degree. Doctoral students will have a maximum of two
opportunities to successfully complete qualifying or final examinations for the
Ph.D. degree.

[8] Accelerated Master's. Qualified senior students at the University of New
Hampshire may be admitted to an approved accelerated graduate program in the
Graduate School provided they have followed normal application procedures; they
must have been admitted for the semester in which they wish to enroll in courses
for dual credit. A 3.20 cumulative grade point average is normally required to
be considered for the program. Students are normally admitted prior to the start
of their senior year. Students who have been admitted to the program may
register for a maximum of 12 credits of 800-­level courses prior to completing
their bachelor's degree. Such courses may, upon recommendation of the department
and approval of the Graduate School, count toward both the bachelor's and
master's degrees. Up to 8 credits, upon recommendation of the department and
approval of the Graduate School, may count towards both the bachelor's degree
and a graduate certificate. For more information and a list of eligible
programs, visit: https://gradschool.unh.edu/academics/accelerated-masters-
program . Consecutive Master's Degrees. Enrollment in consecutive master's
degrees refers to admission and matriculation in a second master's degree
program at the University of New Hampshire after the completion of the
requirements for a first master's degree earned at the University of New
Hampshire. A student may apply up to 12 credits earned in the first master's
degree awarded at the University of New Hampshire toward a second master's
degree with approval of the student's graduate advisory committee and/or
graduate program coordinator in the second master's program. Thesis or research
credits from the first program may not be counted toward the requirements of the
second program. Concurrent Dual Degrees. Enrollment in concurrent dual degrees
occurs when a student is admitted to and matriculated in two graduate degree
programs at the University of New Hampshire simultaneously. A student may pursue
concurrent degrees only with approval of the appropriate graduate program
coordinator(s) and the dean of the Graduate School. With approval of the
student's graduate advisory committee(s) and/or the graduate program
coordinator(s), a student may apply up to 12 UNH credits earned in one master's
degree toward the requirements for a second master's degree. A student must
complete the capstone requirements for both programs. Completion of degree
requirements for the two programs need not be at the same time. Integrated Dual
Degrees. Integrated dual degrees occurs when two graduate programs have
formalized a program of study which creates an integrated program linking the
two disciplines, while continuing toward separate degrees. Students must be
admitted to both programs and complete the requirements for both degrees.
Integrated dual degree programs may include a single admissions process,
submission of a single thesis or capstone experience, and a single advisory
committee composed of members from both programs. The number of required credit
hours for integrated dual degrees must not be less than 80 percent of the total
minimum hours required to complete each degree separately. Integrated dual
degree programs must be approved by the Graduate Council and the dean of the
Graduate School. Cotutelle Ph.D. Agreements with International Universities. A
cotutelle is a Ph.D. jointly awarded by two universities from different
countries. Under such an arrangement, a doctoral student completes the
requirements of the Ph.D. program in both the home and partner university,
conducts dissertation research collaboratively, sequentially, and for roughly
equal amounts of time in both universities, and is supervised by a faculty
member from each of the universities. The dissertation is then examined by a
committee whose members are drawn from both institutions. A degree is awarded
from each university with acknowledgment on the transcript of the cotutelle. All
cotutelles must have a fully approved cotutelle agreement signed by multiple
institutional representatives at both universities including the Office of
International Students and Scholars (OISS). UNH faculty or students interested
in developing a cotutelle should contact the Graduate School to get detailed
instructions about what is required for a cotutelle agreement and the associated
approval process.

[9] Dual Degree Requirements: Section: Public Policy and Juris Doctor Dual Degree
(M.P.P./J.D.) - Public Policy and Juris Doctor Dual Degree (M.P.P./J.D.) - Dual
Degree Requirements

[10] Students enrolled in the Master in Public Policy and Juris Doctor (MPP/JD) Dual
Degree program are required to earn a minimum of 104 credits to successfully
complete the dual degree which confers both an MPP degree and a JD degree. If
both degrees are pursued separately, students are required to take a total of
125 Credits: 85 Credits for the JD degree and 40 Credits for the MPP degree.
With the MPP/JD Dual Degree, the UNH Franklin Pierce Law School accepts up to 12
credits of approved MPP courses and the Carsey School of Public Policy accepts
up to 9 credits of approved JD courses, reducing the total required credits to
104 and time to complete the two degrees to three and one half years, a savings
of one year. It is highly recommended that students meet with their Graduate
Academic Advisors from both programs prior to starting their Dual Degree to
insure they have a clear understanding of each program's prerequisites, degree
requirements, course schedules, and to determine the best time to take their MPP
coursework. Students are required to start their first year of the MPP/JD Dual
Degree program in the fall at the UNH Franklin Pierce Law School and complete at
least one year of their Juris Doctor curriculum ( Juris Doctor: Residential
(J.D.) Program or Juris Doctor: Daniel Webster Scholar Honors (J.D.) Program )
prior to starting their MPP program. Students complete their year of MPP
coursework at the Carsey School of Public Policy in their second or third year
of the MPP/JD Dual Degree program with guidance from their JD Academic Advisor.
Students are advised to have taken an introductory level economics class prior
to starting their MPP program such as a “principles of economics” course (macro
or micro).
